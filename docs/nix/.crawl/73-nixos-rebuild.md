## Content

## Changing the Configuration 

The file `/etc/nixos/configuration.nix` contains the current configuration of your machine. Whenever you’ve [changed something](</manual/nixos/stable/#ch-configuration> "Configuration") in that file, you should do
    
    
    # nixos-rebuild switch
    

to build the new configuration, make it the default configuration for booting, and try to realise the configuration in the running system (e.g., by restarting system services).

### Warning

This command doesn’t start/stop [user services](</manual/nixos/stable/options#opt-systemd.user.services>) automatically. `nixos-rebuild` only runs a `daemon-reload` for each user with running user services.

### Warning

These commands must be executed as root, so you should either run them from a root shell or by prefixing them with `sudo -i`.

You can also do
    
    
    # nixos-rebuild test
    

to build the configuration and switch the running system to it, but without making it the boot default. So if (say) the configuration locks up your machine, you can just reboot to get back to a working configuration.

There is also
    
    
    # nixos-rebuild boot
    

to build the configuration and make it the boot default, but not switch to it now (so it will only take effect after the next reboot).

You can make your configuration show up in a different submenu of the GRUB 2 boot screen by giving it a different _profile name_ , e.g.
    
    
    # nixos-rebuild switch -p test
    

which causes the new configuration (and previous ones created using `-p test`) to show up in the GRUB submenu “NixOS - Profile ‘test’”. This can be useful to separate test configurations from “stable” configurations.

A repl, or read-eval-print loop, is also available. You can inspect your configuration and use the Nix language with
    
    
    # nixos-rebuild repl
    

Your configuration is loaded into the `config` variable. Use tab for autocompletion, use the `:r` command to reload the configuration files. See `:?` or [`nix repl` in the Nix manual](<https://nixos.org/manual/nix/stable/command-ref/new-cli/nix3-repl.html>) to learn more.

Finally, you can do
    
    
    $ nixos-rebuild build
    

to build the configuration but nothing more. This is useful to see whether everything compiles cleanly.

If you have a machine that supports hardware virtualisation, you can also test the new configuration in a sandbox by building and running a QEMU _virtual machine_ that contains the desired configuration. Just do
    
    
    $ nixos-rebuild build-vm
    $ ./result/bin/run-*-vm
    

The VM does not have any data from your host system, so your existing user accounts and home directories will not be available unless you have set `mutableUsers = false`. Another way is to temporarily add the following to your configuration:
    
    
    { users.users.your-user.initialHashedPassword = "test"; }
    

_Important:_ delete the $hostname.qcow2 file if you have started the virtual machine at least once without the right users, otherwise the changes will not get picked up. You can forward ports on the host to the guest. For instance, the following will forward host port 2222 to guest port 22 (SSH):
    
    
    $ QEMU_NET_OPTS="hostfwd=tcp:127.0.0.1:2222-:22" ./result/bin/run-*-vm
    

allowing you to log in via SSH (assuming you have set the appropriate passwords or SSH authorized keys):
    
    
    $ ssh -p 2222 localhost
    

Such port forwardings connect via the VM’s virtual network interface. Thus they cannot connect to ports that are only bound to the VM’s loopback interface (`127.0.0.1`), and the VM’s NixOS firewall must be configured to allow these connections.

## Building Images with `nixos-rebuild build-image`

Nixpkgs contains a variety of modules to build custom images for different virtualization platforms and cloud providers, such as e.g. `amazon-image.nix` and `proxmox-lxc.nix`.

While those can be imported directly, `system.build.images` provides an attribute set mapping variant names to image derivations. Available variants are defined - end extendable - in `image.modules`, an attribute set mapping variant names to NixOS modules.

All of those images can be built via both, their `system.build.image` attribute and the `nixos-rebuild build-image` command.

For example, to build an Amazon image from your existing NixOS configuration, run:
    
    
    $ nixos-rebuild build-image --image-variant amazon
    [...]
    Done. The disk image can be found in /nix/store/[hash]-nixos-image-amazon-25.05pre-git-x86_64-linux/nixos-image-amazon-25.05pre-git-x86_64-linux.vpc
    

To get a list of all variants available, run `nixos-rebuild build-image` without arguments.

**Example 5. Customize specific image variants**

The `image.modules` option can be used to set specific options per image variant, in a similar fashion as [specialisations](</manual/nixos/stable/options#opt-specialisation>) for generic NixOS configurations.

E.g. images for the cloud provider Linode use `grub2` as a bootloader by default. If you are using `systemd-boot` on other platforms and want to disable it for Linode only, you could use the following options:
    
    
    {
      image.modules.linode = {
        boot.loader.systemd-boot.enable = lib.mkForce false;
      };
    }
